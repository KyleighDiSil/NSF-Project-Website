                        &ensp;This NSF website was designed by Clarkson University students and
                        professors to better enable software engineering teachers around
                        the world. This website contains several engaging software engineering
                        projects for professors to pull from. There is also a course
                        structure page for professors to reference when designing their own
                        courses surrounding these projects.<br><br>

                        of this website and how to contact them. We highly encourage creating a
